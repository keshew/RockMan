                     "The Journey Ahead Here’s how it works: You’ve got a map filled with levels. At first, only one level is unlocked, but every time you complete a level, a new one opens up. Your goal? Collect all the coins scattered across the levels and reach the finish line. Doesn’t matter what order you tackle the levels—just make sure no coin is left behind before you hit that finish flag!",
                     "In every level, you'll encounter: Coins: Catch these to increase your balance! Melodies: Essential for completing the level. Don’t let them slip! Eggs and Tomatoes: Avoid these at all costs! If they hit you, you’ll lose a life.",
                     "Lives and Continuing You start each level with a set number of lives. Lose them all, and you can pay coins to keep going. But watch out—each retry doubles the cost!",
                     "Gameplay Mechanics When elements appear on the track, a button lights up in the orange zone. Timing is everything! Let me explain: TAP: When a button appears, tap it as soon as the element enters the orange zone. TAP with a bar: Tap and hold! Keep holding until the bar disappears. Arrows: Swipe in the direction of the arrow as the element hits the zone. Indicators: Green light: Perfect timing! Orange light: Close, but not perfect. Red light: Too early, too late, or completely missed.",
                     "Pro Tips Catch coins and melodies in the orange zone for the best results. Avoid eggs and tomatoes—let them pass by safely. Practice on Easy mode before diving into Hard mode—it gets fast!"]
